                This is <strong>NOT</strong> a full programming course. This is an introduction to the wonders of (C), 
                the <strong>mother of all programming languages</strong>.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>Since the main focus here is cybersecurity</strong>, we will explore how C is used in <strong>Linux, hacking, exploit development, and reverse engineering</strong>.

            <h2> Why Should I Learn C?</h2>
            <p>C is a <strong>low-level</strong> language that provides <strong>direct control over hardware and memory</strong>, making it ideal for cybersecurity, system programming, and exploit development.</p>

            <h2>üêß C in Linux</h2>
            <p>Linux itself is written almost entirely in C. Every time you interact with a <strong>Linux command</strong>, you are using programs that were compiled from C source code.</p>
            <p><strong>Common areas where C is used in Linux:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Kernel Development</strong> - The Linux kernel is written in C.</li>
                <li> <strong>Shell & Command-Line Utilities</strong> - Tools like `ls`, `grep`, `cat` are written in C.</li>
                <li> <strong>Memory Management</strong> - C allows direct interaction with memory, making it highly efficient.</li>
                <li> <strong>Networking & Sockets</strong> - Used in networking tools such as `netcat` and `nmap`.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> C in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>C is widely used in offensive and defensive cybersecurity. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Exploit Development - Many buffer overflow exploits are written in C.</li>
                <li> Reverse Engineering - Malware analysts use C to analyze binary files.</li>
                <li> Network Security - C is used to write custom packet sniffers, firewalls, and rootkits.</li>
                <li> Shellcoding - Hackers write <strong>shellcode</strong> in C to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li> Malware Development - Many viruses, Trojans, and worms are written in C.</li>
            </ul>

                C is an older language compared to other languages in use, and yet it is still very popular. The <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a>, which measures the popularity of programming languages, has C at the top of the list for many years. This is due to C‚Äôs use in all areas of computing.

                Most operating systems today, including the Linux kernel, are implemented with C code. The main version of the Python programming language is named CPython because it is implemented using C. C has also been extended using the languages C++ and C#.

                C is also common in embedded systems, which are smaller computing units that control things like home appliances, lighting controllers, and other small physical devices.

                The C programming language is everywhere. Learning it will help you become a better programmer, ready for the next challenge in any field of computer science.

            <p>
                It is very important to write comments to document the code that we are writing in C language you can add comments by adding a double slash for single-line comments and /* for multi-line comments */ like the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; //this is to include the standard input output library

                int main() { // the beginning of the main function
                    printf("Hello, World!");/* the main function*/
                    return 0;
                }
                </code>

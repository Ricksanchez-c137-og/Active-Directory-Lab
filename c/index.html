                This is <strong>NOT</strong> a full programming course. This is an introduction to the wonders of (C), 
                the <strong>mother of all programming languages</strong>.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>Since the main focus here is cybersecurity</strong>, we will explore how C is used in <strong>Linux, hacking, exploit development, and reverse engineering</strong>.

            <h2> Why Should I Learn C?</h2>
            <p>C is a <strong>low-level</strong> language that provides <strong>direct control over hardware and memory</strong>, making it ideal for cybersecurity, system programming, and exploit development.</p>

            <h2>üêß C in Linux</h2>
            <p>Linux itself is written almost entirely in C. Every time you interact with a <strong>Linux command</strong>, you are using programs that were compiled from C source code.</p>
            <p><strong>Common areas where C is used in Linux:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Kernel Development</strong> - The Linux kernel is written in C.</li>
                <li> <strong>Shell & Command-Line Utilities</strong> - Tools like `ls`, `grep`, `cat` are written in C.</li>
                <li> <strong>Memory Management</strong> - C allows direct interaction with memory, making it highly efficient.</li>
                <li> <strong>Networking & Sockets</strong> - Used in networking tools such as `netcat` and `nmap`.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> C in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>C is widely used in offensive and defensive cybersecurity. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Exploit Development - Many buffer overflow exploits are written in C.</li>
                <li> Reverse Engineering - Malware analysts use C to analyze binary files.</li>
                <li> Network Security - C is used to write custom packet sniffers, firewalls, and rootkits.</li>
                <li> Shellcoding - Hackers write <strong>shellcode</strong> in C to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li> Malware Development - Many viruses, Trojans, and worms are written in C.</li>
            </ul>

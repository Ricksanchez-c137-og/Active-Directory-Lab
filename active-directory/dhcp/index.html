                    What is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)?

                <p>
                    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. It simplifies the process of managing IP addresses and reduces the need for manual configuration.

                <p>
                    In an Active Directory environment, DHCP can be configured to work seamlessly with other network services and directory services. Here's an example setup:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Install the DHCP Server role on a domain-joined Windows Server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Configure DHCP scopes for different subnets and VLANs in the network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Authorize the DHCP server in Active Directory to ensure proper operation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use DHCP policies to apply specific settings to different groups of clients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monitor DHCP server performance and lease information using built-in tools or third-party software.
                    </li>
                </ol>

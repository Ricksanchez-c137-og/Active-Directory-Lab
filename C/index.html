                This is <strong>NOT</strong> a full programming course. This is an introduction to the wonders of **C**, 
                the **mother of all programming languages**.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>Since the main focus here is cybersecurity</strong>, we will explore how C is used in **Linux, hacking, exploit development, and reverse engineering**.

            <h2>🔍 Why Should I Learn C?</h2>
            <p>C is a **low-level** language that provides **direct control over hardware and memory**, making it **ideal for cybersecurity, system programming, and exploit development**.</p>

            <h2>🐧 C in Linux</h2>
            <p>Linux itself is written **almost entirely in C**. Every time you interact with a **Linux command**, you are using programs that were compiled from C source code.</p>
            <p><strong>Common areas where C is used in Linux:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>🛠 **Kernel Development** - The Linux kernel is written in C.</li>
                <li>⚡ **Shell & Command-Line Utilities** - Tools like `ls`, `grep`, `cat` are written in C.</li>
                <li>💾 **Memory Management** - C allows direct interaction with memory, making it highly efficient.</li>
                <li>🔌 **Networking & Sockets** - Used in networking tools such as `netcat` and `nmap`.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🔐 C in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>C is widely used in **offensive and defensive cybersecurity**. Here’s how:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>💀 **Exploit Development** - Many **buffer overflow** exploits are written in C.</li>
                <li>🔍 **Reverse Engineering** - Malware analysts use C to analyze binary files.</li>
                <li>📡 **Network Security** - C is used to write **custom packet sniffers, firewalls, and rootkits**.</li>
                <li>🚀 **Shellcoding** - Hackers write **shellcode** in C to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>🛡️ **Malware Development** - Many viruses, Trojans, and worms are written in C.</li>
            </ul>
